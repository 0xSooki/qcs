## Summary of the meeting
This was our first meeting held via Discord messages. There was a little misunderstanding whether we were having the meeting or not, but since it happened via messages, everyone was able to contribute in the end. Bence created occurring event in Discord so we would always know when a meeting is happening (every Friday at 18:00). We also agreed that we should use voice channel in the future, to make sure that everyone is heard and can get the help needed. We discussed about work division, working practices, software architecture and how we are going to write the project plan document. Henna promised to write the initial version, that would be read and modified by others.
